# **📘 Study-Time Impact Analysis on Student Performance**

## 📌 **Project Overview**

This project explores how the number of study hours influences a student’s academic performance. Using a simple dataset, the analysis focuses on understanding the relationship between study duration and scores, and building a predictive model based on this trend.

---

## 🎯 **Objectives**

* Analyze the correlation between study hours and student scores.
* Visualize trends and patterns using data analytics techniques.
* Build a model to estimate scores based on study duration.
* Interpret results to understand how study habits affect academic performance.
